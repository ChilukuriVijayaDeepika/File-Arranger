Project Name: File Arranger using Python
File Arranger is designed to solve problems faced by users when there are different kinds of files in the folder like videos, audios, pdf files, jpg files, etc. So, to find particular thing from folder it is difficult and time-consuming task for the user. In our project we created a way to resolve this problem using GUI interface where user can select a particular folder that he/she want to organize then click the submit button and check the selected folder then all files will be in organized manner.
